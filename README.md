items_placer
============

Place items in a view with drag &amp; drop (iOS 7)

This is a little exercise I did to practice gesture recognizers, collection view, and snapping effect effect using UIDynamicAnimator. 

We can drag and drop views from the bottom selector to top view. The views can be clicked to see more info. When view is dragged to invalid place it snaps back. Placed views can be removed by dragging back to the bottom.

It needs refactoring, right now everything is in a view controller.
